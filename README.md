This is the brain-storming room for in-coming projects. Will be found here some basic ideation, useful links, code snippets and more.

## ElectPoll Project
We intend, by this project, to develop a mobile app, backed with a web platform to survey, assess, and draw statistics over presidential elections in the Niger Republic(NR).

### Ideation
It's been 30+ years over which the NR is being ruled by the very same group of people. Although it's been 6+ **Democratically elected** presidents and 5+ republics, the key functions in the government have always been distributed among the same group of person who hold the monopol of the top administravtive ranks in this third-world country. 
We start from the observation that so-called democratic elections do not bring about any significant change in the standard of living of the normal citizen of the country. So, the question asked is why this inefficiency of democracy?
We propose, by this project, a different view of this state of affairs. Then we will propose a solution that will allow the citizen to follow the propaganda campaigns of the presidential elections in real time during their evolution from beginning to end. This will allow, in the best case scenario, the citizen to grasp the situation of the political parties and their influence before the elections.

1- Inform citizen
**Presentation of candidates**: in our solution, each candidate in the presidential election will have a page that will present it and will link its program (detailed) and statements. Also any other reliable information about  the candidate and/or his party that will contribute to an informed decision to the citizen will also be made available.
2- Let the citizen speak 
let him vote and see elections emulation.
